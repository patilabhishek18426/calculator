# Simple Calculator Project (HTML, CSS & JavaScript)

# A simple calculator is a basic web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allows a user to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division directly in a web browser. In this project:

# HTML provides the structure of the calculator, including a display screen and buttons for digits and operations.

# CSS is used to style the layout, giving it a clean design and arranging the buttons in a grid layout.

# JavaScript adds interactivity — it detects button clicks, updates the display, and computes the result using the values entered by the user.# calculator
